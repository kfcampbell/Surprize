# Surprize
An menu bar app to use the Unsplash API to download a random picture and set it as my wallpaper every so often.

## Wishlist
    * Do the API work from a helper class
    * Settings to determine what categories of images to download
    * Settings to determine screen resolution
    * Settings to determine location of saved images
    * Settings option to save images or not
    * Settings to run automatically at a certain frequency
    * Ignore duplicate images
    * An Easter egg ;)
