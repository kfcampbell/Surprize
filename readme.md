# Surprize
An menu bar app to use the Unsplash API to download a random picture and set it as my wallpaper every so often.

## Wishlist
    * ignore duplicate images
    * make API calls asynchronously
    * detect user desktop size automatically
    * change wallpaper across external monitors
    * automatically start app on startup
    * package as .dmg on wiki
    * only restart timer when timer preferences actually change
    * package up all the preferences in a singleton and only write when necessary.
    * download images ahead of time and save them so switching wallpapers is instantaneous.
